Code to do ETF financial portfolio optimization.

Most of it has been adapted from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimisation-in-python-e7844051e7f) and [here](https://www.pythonforfinance.net/2019/07/02/investment-portfolio-optimisation-with-python-revisited/). Plenty of other articles can be found via a simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=portfolio+optimization+python). For example check out [this article](https://plot.ly/python/v3/ipython-notebooks/markowitz-portfolio-optimization/#markowitz-optimization-and-the-efficient-frontier) for one involving interactive plots. 

This is just an introduction into a vast field of finance. Check out the [pyportfolioopt](https://pypi.org/project/pyportfolioopt/) package for more advanced implementations, and [this](https://github.com/topics/portfolio-optimization) list of github packages for countless other implementations. Also [this](https://medium.com/swlh/ai-for-portfolio-management-from-markowitz-to-reinforcement-learning-cffedcbba566) article is full of ideas into how machine learning is advancing this field.
